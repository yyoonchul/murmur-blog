Less is more, they say. But what does that really mean?

In design, minimalism isn't about removing things—it's about keeping only what matters. Every element should earn its place.

> "Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away." — Antoine de Saint-Exupéry

I'm trying to apply this to my life too. Fewer possessions, fewer commitments, more focus on what truly matters.
